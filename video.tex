Information for our video
Team 14, Jensen Collins and Makayla Worden

The general theme of the video will revolve around all the unique qualities Ruby has. This includes its many different styles of loop techniques available to use, its interesting way of using its object-oriented design to implement its data structures, in addition to a few other things. 

The main idea we hope to get across is the speical characteristics Ruby has. This language was used to influnence non-programmers to spark an interest in coding. The features and readablity Ruby possesses are one of its main trademarks as a language. While still following guidelines of most object-oriented languages, Ruby has a lot of helpful qualities that take the load off of the programmer, and keep them focused on the implementation of what they are building.

Code samples to be shown will include a demonstration of the different data types, particularly the Number system due to it being different than many other programming languages, a few different syntactically acceptabtle ways to write loops, and a sample of a small program with an explination of what is being implemented.

The program will be demoed by using a screen recording of it in use.

Most likely, we will film our video by first creating a slide deck of our main points, and walking the viewers through our presentation on camera. This way it resembles a in-person presentation as much as possible.
