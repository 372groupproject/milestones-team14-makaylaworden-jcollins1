Our project will implement the game of Hangman. This will have 2 player objects, one that
choses the word to guess and the other that makes the guesses. It will also requires a
hangman object that keeps track of the score.

We expect the program to have quite a few functions, along with different object classes
where each individual object can represent the hangman and both players.

We expect the program to be approximatley 400-500 lines of code

We think this will be a good illustration of the features of our language because it
will utilize it's object oriented build along with taking advantage of the convienent ways
to manipulate strings. Making the game of hangman in particular can also make use of the
different iteration styles that Ruby provides.
