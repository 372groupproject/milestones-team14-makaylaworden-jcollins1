(1) helloWorld.ruby
    - This is a very basic ruby file that prints "hello world" to the console. It has a method
      called hello which uses the keywork 'puts' which prints to the console the String 
      "hello world" and then 'exit' returns from the method and the while loop is exited and
      the program finishes. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save helloWorld.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has helloWorld.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby helloWorld.ruby
            - This will compile and run the program and "hello world" should print to the console
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file helloWorld.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run the program and "hello world" should print to the console
            
(2) milestone1code.ruby
    - This is a short snippet of Ruby code that shows some of the unique syntax in a short 
      amount of code. To start, there is a method called surround that takes in three parameters.
      The third parameter in a pointer to a array of objects, in this case Strings. It takes
      each element and surrounds it with a certain bracket type. Then there is another method
      named printer that takes in 4 parameters. These parameters can be filled in by sending
      it individual values or a pointer with an array of values. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save milestone1code.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has milestone1code.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby milestone1code.ruby
            - This will compile and run the program and two lines should print to the console
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file milestone1code.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run the program and two lines should print to the console
