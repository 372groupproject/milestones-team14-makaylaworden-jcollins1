------------------------------------------- MILESTONE 1 -------------------------------------------

(1) helloWorld.ruby
    - This is a very basic ruby file that prints "hello world" to the console. It has a method
      called hello which uses the keywork 'puts' which prints to the console the String 
      "hello world" and then 'exit' returns from the method and the while loop is exited and
      the program finishes. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save helloWorld.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has helloWorld.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby helloWorld.ruby
            - This will compile and run the program and "hello world" should print to the console
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file helloWorld.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run the program and "hello world" should print to the console
            
(2) milestone1code.ruby
    - This is a short snippet of Ruby code that shows some of the unique syntax in a short 
      amount of code. To start, there is a method called surround that takes in three parameters.
      The third parameter in a pointer to a array of objects, in this case Strings. It takes
      each element and surrounds it with a certain bracket type. Then there is another method
      named printer that takes in 4 parameters. These parameters can be filled in by sending
      it individual values or a pointer with an array of values.

              change
              
(3) p3_boolean.ruby
    - This small program will show different ways booleans can be ulitilized with Ruby. There are
      four standard boolean values. True which is always true, false which is always false, nil 
      which is always false, and 0 which is always true. Ruby can also support logical operators

      within Ruby. Integers and floating point numbers can be used for arithmetic computations
      and be able to traverse in a loop. Since everyting is an object in Ruby, Integers are able
      to be used as such and have certain methods that can be invoked to start a loop. You can 
      also change the type of Integer and floating point easily. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save p3_numbers.ruby onto your machine

              Strings in different ways
              
(7) p3_symbols.ruby
    - This small program shows how to use symbols in Ruby. Symbols in Ruby are immutable and act
      as a light-weight String in that they have a slightly better performance and take up less
      memory. Symbols can be thought of as Enums which are commom in many other languages
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save p3_symbols.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has p3_symbols.ruby

        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file p3_symbols.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run the program and will print the symbols and their values
              
(8) p3_runtime_error.ruby
    - This small program shows how to create different types of runtime errors when coding in 
      Ruby. The first example shows how to use the 'raise' keyword to throw an exception at 
      any time and make the program crash. This will occur if line 22 is not commented out
      because line 22 calls the method that invokes the 'raise' keyword. If line 22 is commented
      out, then the program will cause an ArgumentError when calling the next method inverse().
      It will cause as error because it will pass in a String when it needs to be a number of some
      sorts. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save p3_runtime_error.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has p3_runtime_error.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby p3_runtime_error.ruby
            - This will compile and run to the point where it hits the 'raise' keyword or 
              when it reaches the ArgumentError. 
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file p3_runtime_error.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run to the point where it hits the 'raise' keyword or
              when it reaches the ArgumentError
              
(9) p3_handle_exceptions.ruby
    - This small program shows how to get around an exception without allowing the program 
      to crash. The keyword to catch an exception is 'rescue'. This will allow for the 
      program to rescue the error and be able to continue successfully
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save p3_handle_exceptions.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has p3_handle_exceptions.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby p3_handle_exceptions.ruby
            - This will compile and run the program and show the results of getting around an
              exception

            - Load the file p3_handle_exceptions.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run the program and show the results of getting around an
              exception
              
(10) p3_compile_errors.ruby
    - This small program shows how to create compiler errors when coding in Ruby. This program
      creates two different types of compiler errors. The first is a NameError because a 
      variable was used before it was declared. The second is a syntax error because the array
      that is being declared is missing the end ']'. You will have to commment out line 13 to
      see the syntax error message
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save p3_compile_errors.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has p3_compile_errors.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby p3_compile_errors.ruby
            - This will not compile or run because it contains two compiler errors that will
              cause the program to crash
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file p3_numbers.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will not compile or run because it contains two compiler errrors that will
              cause the program to crash
