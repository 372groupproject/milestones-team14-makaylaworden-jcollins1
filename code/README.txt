------------------------------------------- MILESTONE 1 -------------------------------------------

(1) helloWorld.ruby
    - This is a very basic ruby file that prints "hello world" to the console. It has a method
      called hello which uses the keywork 'puts' which prints to the console the String 
      "hello world" and then 'exit' returns from the method and the while loop is exited and
      the program finishes. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save helloWorld.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has helloWorld.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby helloWorld.ruby
            - This will compile and run the program and "hello world" should print to the console
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file helloWorld.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run the program and "hello world" should print to the console
            
(2) milestone1code.ruby
    - This is a short snippet of Ruby code that shows some of the unique syntax in a short 
      amount of code. To start, there is a method called surround that takes in three parameters.
      The third parameter in a pointer to a array of objects, in this case Strings. It takes
      each element and surrounds it with a certain bracket type. Then there is another method
      named printer that takes in 4 parameters. These parameters can be filled in by sending
      it individual values or a pointer with an array of values. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save milestone1code.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has milestone1code.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby milestone1code.ruby
            - This will compile and run the program and two lines should print to the console
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file milestone1code.ruby into the workspace
            - Click Packages -> Script -> Run Script
            - This will compile and run the program and two lines should print to the console
            
------------------------------------------- MILESTONE 2 -------------------------------------------

(1) r2_case.ruby
    - This is a short snippet of Ruby code that shows how to use a case statement. There are a 
      couple varities with being able to use an 'else' or not. The main keywords are 'case' and 
      'when' and work similarily to other case statement found in other popular languages. 
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save p2_case.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:
            - From the command line go into the directory that has p2_case.ruby
            - Print the command: ruby p2_case.ruby
            - This will compile and run the program and two lines should print to the console
        (b) Atom editor:
            - Load the file p2_case.ruby into the workspace

            - This will compile and run the program and two lines should print to the console
            
(2) p2_for.ruby
    - This is a short snippet of Ruby code that shows how to use a for loop. There are a couple
      varities where you can use a for-loop or a for each-loop. Each are shown in the file and 
      it shows how some variables change within the loop.
    - To compile and run this program:
        - Download and save p2_for.ruby onto your machine
        (a) Command Line:

(3) p2_if.ruby
    - This is a short snippet of Ruby code that shows how to use a if statement. There are a 
      couple of varities that use different syntax. There is also an if-elsif-else in Ruby and
      is shown within the file.
